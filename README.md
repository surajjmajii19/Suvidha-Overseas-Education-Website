# Suvidha-Overseas-Education-Website

I developed a comprehensive Full Stack WordPress website for an NGO to support their Overseas Education initiative. The project involved creating a user-friendly interface that highlights the NGO's mission, educational programs, and resources for students seeking opportunities abroad. I integrated essential features like a course catalog, student testimonials, and an inquiry form to facilitate smooth communication between prospective students and the NGO. Additionally, I ensured that the website was responsive and optimized for performance, providing a seamless experience across various devices. Hosting the site on InfinityFree Site Hoster, I successfully completed the project with a focus on accessibility and functionality.
